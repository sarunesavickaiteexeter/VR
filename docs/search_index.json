VR systems are intricate combinations of technology and human perception. It is commonly described as an artificial environment controlled, at least partially, by user interactions, experienced through computer-generated sensory input such as sights and sounds. A simpler definition characterizes VR as an artificial environment experienced through various senses, created by a computer and accessed through a display, most commonly a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). An HMD consists of large glasses that project two separate images, one to each eye, creating the convincing illusion of a three-dimensional scene surrounding the user. In addition to cutting-edge graphics, a VR system typically includes one or more input devices such as controllers, gloves, or motion trackers.
