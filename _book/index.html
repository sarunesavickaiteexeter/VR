<p><strong>What is Virtual Reality (VR)?</strong></p>
<p>Defining Virtual Reality can be as complex as the experience itself. VR systems are intricate combinations of technology and human perception. It is commonly described as an artificial environment controlled, at least partially, by user interactions, experienced through computer-generated sensory input such as sights and sounds. A simpler definition characterizes VR as an artificial environment experienced through various senses, created by a computer and accessed through a display, most commonly a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). An HMD consists of large glasses that project two separate images, one to each eye, creating the convincing illusion of a three-dimensional scene surrounding the user. In addition to cutting-edge graphics, a VR system typically includes one or more input devices such as controllers, gloves, or motion trackers.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Jaron Lanier introduced the term “Virtual Reality” (VR). Virtual Reality enjoyed initial popularity during the 1980s and 1990s but quickly lost momentum due to technological limitations and high costs. At the time, the primary areas of research were focused on engineering, aeronautics, and visual perception. However, in 2014, Facebook (now Meta) acquired the start-up company Oculus, signaling the start of a new chapter for Virtual Reality. Over recent years, technological advances have made VR more affordable and accessible. This has led to a growing interest in immersive technologies like augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR). Today, Virtual Reality (VR) encompasses a variety of technologies, including virtual worlds (VW), massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), virtual collaborative environments, cave automatic virtual environments (CAVE), smartphone-based static VR, and Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs).</p>
<p>The capabilities of VR systems vary significantly based on the power of the hardware and the quality of the virtual world they create. Key features of all VR systems include immersion, interaction, and a sense of presence. Immersion refers to how effectively the technology isolates the user from reality, allowing them to interact with virtual objects in real-time. Immersion is closely linked to the system’s hardware capabilities. Together, immersion and interaction foster a sense of presence, the psychological feeling of “being there” in a virtual environment, even though the user is physically located in the real world. Virtual Reality technologies can generate highly immersive, realistic, and secure environments. In the past decade, various fields of psychology have increasingly embraced this technology to conduct controlled and ecologically valid experiments.</p>
<p><em>What is presence?</em></p>
<p>Presence refers to the internal sensation of “being immersed” in a virtual environment, giving the user a sense of genuinely existing within it. It involves the emotional and psychological bond that users form with the virtual space.</p>
<p>Presence functions as both a mental state and a personal viewpoint, as a user’s individual experiences shape their perception of the virtual world. Their emotions are influenced and molded by the virtual environment and the technology that supports it.</p>
<p>Presence is crucial in virtual reality (VR) because it plays a key role in determining the quality of the user’s experience. When presence is heightened, users become more engaged, emotionally connected, and feel a stronger link to the VR environment.</p>
<p><em>Presence vs Immersion</em></p>
<p>While presence and immersion are interconnected in virtual reality (VR), they have distinct roles.</p>
<p>Presence relates to the user’s mental state and perception, emphasizing how effectively the virtual environment makes them forget the physical world. It is about the sensation of “being there,” where users become absorbed in the virtual space, even though they are aware of the artificial nature of the objects, events, and characters, sometimes ignoring the underlying technology. Conversely, immersion is more focused on the technology itself (such as the VR headset) and how effectively it stimulates the user’s senses to create a believable virtual world.</p>
<p>When presence is strong, users genuinely feel like they are within the virtual world, and the quality of the technology becomes secondary as long as the illusion is maintained. A high degree of immersion helps build a convincing virtual environment, making it easier for users to let go of reality.</p>
<p>Presence is enhanced by immersion. The more immersive the VR system, the greater the likelihood that users will experience a deep sense of presence. Both presence and immersion work together to create a realistic and engaging VR experience, ultimately shaping how users perceive and connect with the virtual environment.</p>
<p>If you are interested to learn more about how to understand presence and immersion through the lense of UI/UX design, you can find more information and examples on [link] (<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/presence" class="uri">https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/presence</a>), which also has some interesting links on UI/UX should you wish to explore that space more.</p>
